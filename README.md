# sign-up-form
An Odin Project featuring a simple sign up form

This project is all about some intermediate

looking at forms, this project will involve:

- Styling a webpage with multiple sections
using flexbox
- Including different input fields including
text, tel, email, & password
- Including a submit button
- Handling some simple client side html validation
- Using custom fonts
- Revisiting image and background css features
- Linking to another login page (self-given additional
task)
